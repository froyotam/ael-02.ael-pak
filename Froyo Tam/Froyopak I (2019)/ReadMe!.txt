Hiyo! It's Froyo!

Thank you for downloading this free resource pack!


This pack includes:

Blotter – a blobject typeface made out of metaballs. Includes 3d models and Cinema 4D project file.

Butterfly – Forms used in some of my works that are based on Ultra Hi-Gloss, a font you can buy at itemLabel.com [https://itemlabel.com/products/ultra-hi-gloss-font]

Textures/Scans – Many are iridescent textures I've been using in my works (most notably for Ivy Hollivana's Breaking Point music video). Some scans are taken from scanning FP-100c bleached negatives on a flatbed, and the last scan is from a book checkout insert from my school's library.


Usage:

You are free to use these resources on any personal or commercial works. This also includes permission to use for printing (e.g. clothing, poster work, etc.)
